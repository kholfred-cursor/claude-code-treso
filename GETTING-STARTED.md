## 📚 Understanding the 3-Tier Architecture

### Skills (Tier 1: Contextual Helpers)
- **What:** Helpers invoked by Claude during conversations
- **When:** Claude activates them when contextually relevant
- **Examples:** code-reviewer, test-generator, security-auditor

**Think of skills like:** Smart autocomplete - activates when relevant to your current discussion

### Sub-Agents (Tier 2: Manual Experts)
- **What:** Invoked specialists for deep analysis
- **When:** You explicitly call them (`@agent`)
- **Examples:** @code-reviewer, @test-engineer, @docs-writer

**Think of sub-agents like:** Consulting an expert - you ask when you need deep help

### Commands (Tier 3: Workflows)
- **What:** Multi-agent orchestrated workflows
- **When:** You run a command (`/command`)
- **Examples:** /review, /scaffold, /test-gen

**Think of commands like:** Running a script - automates complex multi-step processes

---

## 🔧 Configuration (Optional)

### Sandboxing (Advanced Users)

**Default:** Sandboxing is OFF (all skills work without it)

**Enable sandboxing** for additional security isolation:

```bash
# During installation
./scripts/install.sh --skills-only --sandboxing

# Or configure manually per skill
vim ~/.claude/skills/security-auditor/config.json
```

**When to enable:**
- High-security environments
- Untrusted code analysis
- Compliance requirements

**See:** [SANDBOXING-GUIDE.md](SANDBOXING-GUIDE.md) for details

---

### Customization

**Customize existing skills:**

```bash
# Copy skill and modify
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/code-reviewer \
      ~/.claude/skills/company-code-reviewer

# Edit for your standards
vim ~/.claude/skills/company-code-reviewer/SKILL.md
```

**Create new skills:**

See [skills/TEMPLATES.md](skills/TEMPLATES.md) for copy-paste templates

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify skill installed
ls ~/.claude/skills/ | grep skill-name

# Check Claude Code recognizes it
claude --list-skills
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Reinstall skill
./scripts/install.sh --skills-only
```

### Command Not Found

**Check:**
```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/ | grep command-name
```

**Fix:**
```bash
./scripts/install.sh --commands-only
```

### Sub-Agent Error

**Common issue:** Tool access restrictions

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check agent configuration
cat ~/.claude/agents/agent-name.json

# Verify allowed-tools includes required tools
```

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Issue:** `./scripts/install.sh` not executable

**Fix:**
```bash
# Use Git Bash (recommended)
bash ./scripts/install.sh

# Or use WSL
wsl bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

**Issue:** Permission denied on `~/.claude`

**Fix (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
# Create directory if missing
New-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude" -ItemType Directory -Force

# Set permissions
icacls "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude" /grant "$env:USERNAME:(OI)(CI)F"
```

**Issue:** Path not found `~/.claude`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Windows uses different home directory
# In Git Bash: ~/.claude maps to C:\Users\YourName\.claude
ls "$USERPROFILE/.claude"  # PowerShell
ls ~/.claude               # Git Bash
```
